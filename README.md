Experience learned from this project:
This is my very first project at RED Academy for the Web Developer Professional Program. Since this was my first time coding and building a website, using floats were definitely a challenge, especially the Skills section. Learning to use Clearfix helped a lot with the spacing. 

Although on my first attempt I did not get 100% of the design specs, I felt that I came extreme close and was very happy with the project overall. I had lots of fun building my first project and was looking forward to my 2nd.
