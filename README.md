View deployed site through [GitHub Pages.](http://codejlay.github.io/project01-laura-ipsum-resume/)

**Summary:**

A one-page online website for Laura Ipsum.


**Tools and methods used to build site:**

- HTML/CSS
- Float property
- Font Squirrel
- Responsive design
- Faux parallax scrolling effect using background-position: fixed


**Experience from the project:**

This is my very first project at RED Academy for the Web Developer Professional Program. Since this was my first time coding and building a website, using floats were definitely a challenge, especially the Skills section. Learning to use Clearfix helped a lot with the spacing. 

Although on my first attempt I did not get 100% of the design specs, I felt that I came extremely close and was very happy with the project overall. I had lots of fun building my first project and was looking forward to my 2nd.
